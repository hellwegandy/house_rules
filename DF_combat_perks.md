# Dungeon Fantasy Combat Perks
Combat Perks represent slick moves or dirty tricks useful in a fight. They’re available to anybody who meets the prerequisites. Most delvers may buy one Combat Perk per full 20 points invested in “combat skills,” a category encompassing any skill that permits attacks or active defenses, with bare hands or weapons (melee or ranged), plus all Fast-Draw skills, and techniques based on those skills..

### Trademark Move
Each player may work out a few “trademark moves” that cover an entire turn’s worth of actions, and write down the effects in advance. For instance, “All-Out Attack (Strong) for 2d+3 cutting, thrown as a Rapid Strike with a chop to the neck, at skill 13, followed by a Deceptive slash at the torso for -2 defenses, at skill 14.” To encourage this, anyone who takes the time to work out a trademark move and spends a point on the perk, gains a Trademark Move perk that gives +1 to all skill rolls made during that move. Trademark Moves do not count toward the limit for Combat Perks.

### Knights
Knights - whose sole concern is fighting – may purchase one perk per full 10 points in combat skills.

### Swashbucklers
Swashbucklers may purchase one extra perk per full 20 points in Broadsword, Fast-Draw (Sword), Fast-Draw (TwoHanded Sword), Rapier, Saber, Shortsword, Smallsword, and Two-Handed Sword from the list on **DFDS p.21-24**. 

### Martial Artists
Martial Artists may purchase one extra perk per full 20 points in weapon skills from the monk template plus points in chi/special skills from the Martial Arts book. (You may request perks from another class, but with a martial-artist twist on them.)
