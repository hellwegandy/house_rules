# Dungeon Fantasy Combat Perks
Combat Perks represent slick moves or dirty tricks useful in a fight. They’re available to anybody who meets the prerequisites. Most delvers may buy one Combat Perk per full 20 points invested in “combat skills,” a category encompassing any skill that permits attacks or active defenses, with bare hands or weapons (melee or ranged), plus all Fast-Draw skills.

### Trademark Move
This does not apply to any perk limits.

Knights - whose sole concern is fighting – may purchase one perk per full 10 points in combat skills.

### Swashbucklers
Swashbucklers may purchase one extra perk per full 20 points in Broadsword, Fast-Draw (Sword), Fast-Draw (TwoHanded Sword), Rapier, Saber, Shortsword, Smallsword, and Two-Handed Sword from the list on **DFDS p.21-24**.
