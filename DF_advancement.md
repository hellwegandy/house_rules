# Dungeon Fantasy Advancement
We are using character templates from DF1, DF4, DF7, DF12, DFDB, DFDS, and more! Each delver can buy only abilities found on his original template plus the templates associated with any lenses he has bought, with few exceptions.

### Attributes and Secondary Characteristics:
**Training Cost:** Free!

Adventurers can buy whatever they can afford, within normal limits (pp. B14-17). If a wizard really wants ST 20, he can have it. A barbarian can raise ST more cheaply; a knight, more effectively. Neither risks being overshadowed by Pointy-thePrestidigitator’s steroids.

### Advantages, Powers, Skills, and Spells:
**Training Costs:** new $40/point, higher level $20/point

A hero can only add these from his template. He can raise those that come in levels to the built-in maximum (e.g., Outdoorsman 4), and a delver with a lens can do this for all his templates. Additional abilities available to every delver are listed on **DF11 p.10-16**. Abilities unique to his templates can be found on **DF11 p.17-37**

### Multi-class:
**Training Cost:** $2000

Another dungeon fantasy standby is the hero who pursues more than one adventuring profession. Adding the lens for one role to the template for another creates a hero who’s most strongly defined by his base template but who also has some key abilities of the second. After adding a lens, the player can spend earned points on abilities from his PC’s base template or the template that corresponds to his new lens. Multi-class lenses are found on **DF3 p.17-37**

A player patient enough to save up 50 unspent points may add a lens to his PC in play. An adventurer never has to spend points on advantages or skills he already has, though; e.g., if he has Combat Reflexes, which costs 15 points, then any lens with that advantage costs him 35 points, not 50 - though he'll still need to pay the full $2000. He may also add the lens gradually, but must pay the $2000 before adding Advantages, Powers, Skills, and Spells from outside his base template. When adding the lens gradually, after the $2000 is paid, any spent points must go towards the lens until the whole lens is added.
